# daily-logs
A log of my daily work to become better

The purpose of this git is just be a dump of all the different things that I have learnt per day and all the projects
that are thrown in one place so that I can see what I was doing with commit history.

The goal really is just go free flow in terms of what the source may contain but just have some sort of history of what
you are intentending to do.

Find daily logs in CHANGELOG.md of what I have been upto.
